The system achieves this through a multi-stage process that involves data 
collection, analysis, decision making, and communication. By continuously 
monitoring the physical dynamics of the surroundings, the system can 
identify weeds, through the data base that has been used to train yolo V3. 
Upon detection, the system can give buzzer sound along with the pointing 
laser on the weed. 
Furthermore, the introduction of machine learning algorithms elevates the 
system's capabilities by enabling it to learn from past data and improve 
accuracy over time. As the system processes and analyses vast amounts of 
data, it can recognize weeds and plants, and differentiate between them, 
resulting in more reliable detection.
